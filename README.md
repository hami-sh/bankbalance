Implementing Barefoot Investor's Model for Up Banking

## Quick Setup
1. Get a up banking API token, and place in `secrets.json` like so:
```
{
    "up_api_key": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
}
```
2. Edit the config to your liking, and change the names of your bank accounts to follow the [barefoot investor scheme](https://www.pocketsmith.com/blog/the-barefoot-investor-buckets-and-accounts-explained/). 
Samples are included already.

3. Run `python3 main.py [payday/balance]`
